    <p class="bio"> My name is Mariya and I am from North Carolina! I am currently a junior <i>
      (class of 2026 bc of my schools five year program... but anyways.)</i> I have a passion for
      computer science and hope to study it at university in the future. My favorite hobbies
      are drawing, listening to music, playing games, and watching new movies when I have the
      time. I also love cherry tomatoes, dots, and peanut M&Ms. <br /><br />

      as a young computer scientist!)

        As a 2023 participant in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersions program, I<br>
        coded a game in <a href="https://beyond-the-horizon-mariya-t.marlol2.repl.co/" target="_blank">Javascript</a>
        inspired by the theme of progression and hope.<br>
        This dramatic fantasy is inspired by the pixelated aspects of Stardew<br>
        Valley and old arcade games.

        <i>Woo!</i> Cinnamari is an up and coming stationary shop featuring pastel <br>
        designs created for children in underpriviledged areas. The intention of this <br>
        shop is to create eco-friendly products that can be shipped to local <br>
        elementary schools to enable creative learning processes.  This mockup was<br> 
        created in Figma, an effective UI system.
